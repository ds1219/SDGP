Doctor of Medicine of the University of
London, and proceeded to Netley to go
through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies
there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment
was stationed in India at the time, and before I
could join it, the second Afghan war had broken
out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps
had advanced through the passes, and was already
deep in the enemyâ€™s country. I followed, however,
with many other officers who were in the same
situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at
once entered upon my new duties."""
